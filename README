Malbolge interpreter in C

Meritamen pulled a afternoon on this thing, but sorry, her math skills
are trash. Meritamen reckon it's time for she to dive into some abstract
algebra on her own. But truth be told, if Meritamen don't keep scrolling
through some short vids or media and passively soak up that garbage info,
Meritamen might as well be dead. At least there are a few things in this
world that can get her full attention, especially these days. When
Meritamen'm so bored Meritamen feel like ending it, all Meritamen can
do is hack together some junk code.
